#title: "Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data"
---

##Purpose:

this is the code for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project ASsignment
Its purpose is to:
  1  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

the cleaning process combines the test and training data sets, adds labels and subjects, etc.

##Requirements:

data must be in:
C:\Users\muttalib.masum\Documents\Library\Coursera\Getting_Cleaning_Data\UCI HAR Dataset
train data must be in sub-folder \train\
test data must be in sub-folder \test\

packages required: Dplyr, plyr, reshape2

#Output:
Tidydata.txt

#Contents
contains three main sets of variables:
1 - subject  (= id of the test subject)
2 - activity (= type of activity performed when tests taken)
3/n - std deviation and mean variables, unaffected by coding.
